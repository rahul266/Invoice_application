# Invoice Application
I have developed an web application which can generate an invoice and mail it. We can update status of the clinets payment. we can add items during billing.<br />
NOTE:<br />
**In app.js :310 and 311 write the email credentials of the sender. code uses the specified email to send the invoice to the client.<br />
**While entering the new client invoice do not use spaces in the name.<br />
** status should only be "due" or "paid"<br /> 
Thank You.<br />
